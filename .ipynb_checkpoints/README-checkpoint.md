## Introduction to the Dataset
This multivariate heart disease dataset, compiled in 1988 from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V, contains 76 attributes per patient, although most studies focus on a refined subset of 14 key predictors. The dataset includes both continuous variables (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure) and categorical variables (e.g., chest pain type, thalassemia, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy), providing a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative patient data. This combination enables comprehensive predictive analysis, with the target variable indicating heart disease presence (0 for no disease, 1 for disease), making the dataset ideal for statistical modeling and machine learning applications in cardiology.
